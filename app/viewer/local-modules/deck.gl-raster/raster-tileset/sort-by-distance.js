/**
 * Sort `items` in place by ascending squared Euclidean distance of each

 * `getCenter` is called exactly once per item (O(n) pre-pass) — never from
 * inside the sort comparator. This keeps the per-viewport cost bounded:
 * one center computation per tile plus one sort of precomputed numbers.
 *
 * Equal-distance items retain their original relative order (stable sort
 * per ES2019 `Array.prototype.sort` spec).
 *
 * For `items.length < 2` this is a no-op and `getCenter` is not called.
 *
 * Caller-side short-circuits (e.g. `n <= maxRequests`) should be applied
 * before invoking this helper when they would skip useful work entirely.

/**
 * Sort `items` in place by ascending distance of each item's center from

 * The reference point is the midpoint of `viewport.getBounds()`, which is
 * always WGS84 `[minLon, minLat, maxLon, maxLat]` regardless of viewport
 * type (Mercator, Globe, etc.). `getCenter` must return each item's center
 * in the same WGS84 space so the comparison is meaningful — callers
 * working in a projected CRS should run their tile/source centers through
 * the descriptor's `projectTo4326` before returning.
 *
 * `getCenter` is called exactly once per item; see
 * {@link sortByDistanceFromPoint} for the underlying perf contract and the
 * `items.length < 2` short-circuit. Caller-side short-circuits such as
 * `length <= maxRequests` should still be applied before invoking this
 * helper when they would skip useful work entirely.
