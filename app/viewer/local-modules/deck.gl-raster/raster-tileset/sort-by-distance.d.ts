/**
 * Sort `items` in place by ascending distance of each item's center from

 * The reference point is the midpoint of `viewport.getBounds()`, which is
 * always WGS84 `[minLon, minLat, maxLon, maxLat]` regardless of viewport
 * type (Mercator, Globe, etc.). `getCenter` must return each item's center
 * in the same WGS84 space so the comparison is meaningful — callers
 * working in a projected CRS should run their tile/source centers through
 * the descriptor's `projectTo4326` before returning.
 *
 * `getCenter` is called exactly once per item; see
 * {@link sortByDistanceFromPoint} for the underlying perf contract and the
 * `items.length < 2` short-circuit. Caller-side short-circuits such as
 * `length <= maxRequests` should still be applied before invoking this
 * helper when they would skip useful work entirely.
